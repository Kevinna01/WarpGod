# **Warp God**
_By a psyker, for the psykers_

Tailor-made mod for personal use to make my OP build viable.

---

## **Features**
- **Warp Unbound Talent Bug Hotfix**
  - Fixes a bug affecting the Electrokinetic Staff, Purgatus Staff, and Smite.
  - Prevents unexpected explosions by disabling additional inputs which would generate peril for a small time window when the bug usually occurs.
  
- **Prevent Peril of the Warp Explosion**
  - Prevents explosions by disabling additional inputs which would generate peril when at 100% peril.
  - Very overpowered feature; can be disabled.
  - Use at your own discretion.

---

## **Disclaimer**
- **Bugs**  
  - Crash Bug at Start Screen, hotfixed with a 10-second delay.  You must press `[SPACE]` within 10 seconds of launching the game.
  - Possible to still explode with Assail if spam-throwing knives while just below 100% peril.

- **Warp Unbound Bug Fix**  
  - Default settings values:  
    - `Disable_Duration = 0.7`  
    - `Disable_Start_Delay = 0.9`  
  - There's still a small probability of the bug occurring.  
  - You can tweak the settings to potentially find better values.
## **Build I made this mod for**
I was exploring how to make the most broken build while skirting around the ToS with mods and macros, this is what I came up with.
