# **Warp God**
_By a psyker, for the psykers_

Tailor-made mod for personal use to make my OP build viable.

---

## **Features**
- **Warp Unbound Talent Bug Hotfix**
  - Fixes a bug affecting the Electrokinetic Staff, Purgatus Staff, and Smite.
  - Prevents unexpected explosions by disabling the Primary Attack during a small time frame.
  
- **Warp Unbound Timer**
  - Modified version of the WarpUnboundTimer mod's timer.
  - Plays an audio notification when the timer is about to end.
  
- **Prevent Peril of the Warp Explosion**
  - Very overpowered feature; can be disabled.
  - Use at your own discretion.

---

## **Mod Requirements**
- **Audio Plugin** _(Optional)_
  - Without the Audio Plugin, the timer notification sound will not play.

---

## **Disclaimer**
- **Bugs**  
  - Crash Bug at Start Screen, hotfixed with a 10-second delay.  You must press `[SPACE]` within 10 seconds of launching the game.
  - It's still possible to exceed max peril with force swords.
  - Possible to still explode with Assail if spam-throwing knives while just below 100% peril.
  - Uses a modified version of the WarpUnboundTimer mod's timer.  Having both mods installed might cause conflicts.

- **Warp Unbound Bug Fix**  
  - Default settings values:  
    - `Disable_Duration=0.7`  
    - `Disable_Start_Delay=0.9`  
  - There's still a small probability of the bug occurring.  
  - You can tweak the settings to potentially find better values.
