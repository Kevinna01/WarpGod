# **Warp God**
_By a psyker, for the psykers_

Tailor-made mod for personal use to make my OP build viable.

---

## **Features**
- **Warp Unbound Talent Bug Hotfix**
  - Fixes a bug affecting the Electrokinetic Staff, Purgatus Staff, and Smite; where you can still explode during a small time-interval even if Warp Unbound is activated.
  - Prevents unexpected explosions by disabling additional inputs which would generate peril for a small time window when the bug usually occurs.
  
- **Prevent Peril of the Warp Explosion**
  - Prevents explosions by disabling additional inputs which would generate peril when at 100% peril.
  - Very overpowered feature; can be disabled. Use at your own discretion.

---

## **Disclaimer**
- **Bugs**  
  - Possible to still explode with Assail, if spam-throwing knives while just below 100% peril.

- **Warp Unbound Bug Fix**  
  - Default settings values is what worked for me
  - There's might still persist a small probability of the bug occurring, am not sure how to replicate, but with version 2.0 I have have not yet encounted the bug, so it should be reliable.
  - You can tweak the settings to potentially find better values.
