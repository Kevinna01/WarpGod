# WarpGod
Features
Warp Unbound talent bug hotfix. Bug affects Electrokinetic Staff, Purgatus Staff, Smite. Prevent unexpected explosion by disabling Primary Attack during small time frame.
Warp Unbound Timer, modified version of the WarpUnboundTimer mod's timer, plays an audio notification when timer is about to end.
Prevent Peril of the Warp Explosion. Very overpowered feature,  can be disabled, use at own discretion.

Mod Requirements
Audio Plugin ( OPTIONAL:  it will simply not play any timer notification sound without Audio Plugin.)

Disclaimer
Crash bug at start screen, hotfixed with 10s delay, you have to press [SPACE] within 10s of launching game.
Warp Unbound bug fix, default settings values: Disable_Duration=0.7, Disable_Start_Delay=0.9. There's still a small probability of bug occuring, you can tweak the settings to possibly find better values.
Still possible to exceed max peril with force swords.
Uses modified version of the WarpUnboundTimer mod's timer,  not sure if having both might cause conflicts.
